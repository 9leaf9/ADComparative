Introduction 
we propose a paired comparative deep learning method that measures the
differences of group category (G-CAT) and subject mini-mental state examination (S-MMSE), respectively,
to enhance the sMRI features of groups and individuals. This proposed model has been evaluated on
the ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and MIRIAD datasets.
